I'm really interested in how we can better engage in meaningful work. 
Or, alternately, how we can keep from getting distracted by non-meaningful work.
I spent a few years working on a startup with a friend, focused on attention management. 
I was super-proud of the interface I designed and built, and of the total service we built together.
 But in the end, we couldn't get enough paying subscribers to justify the work that was involved in keeping it going.
