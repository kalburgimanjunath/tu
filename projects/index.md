##You know what's the best thing ever? Making stuff!
When I'm fired up, I'm inspired and I make stuff. When I'm sad, I make stuff and cheer up. 
When my daughters are fighting, I steer them towards making something, and the problems dissolve. 
I'm lucky beyond measure that my job is 90% "making stuff."
