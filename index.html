		I'm an Indian web developer. That means I run a small web-based business that makes the world better.
		My main project is credmine.tk, the simplest profiling tool on earth.
		I'm super-close to launching a from-the-ground-up rewrite of it. Can't wait to show it to you.
I live in Bangalore & Hubli with my parents and three sisters, in a house we built. I love meeting up with People From the Internet, so if that sounds like you, let's hang out sometime.

		Technology is my passion, and has always been since I was a kid. In particular, I have always been interested in programming, security, and all the technologies which nowadays make it possible to easily share information and communicate across the globe, namely the Internet. 
		
		</p>
		<p class="well well-transparent">
		want to get together to talk about the web, technology or anything else that we may have in common, feel free to reach out. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy reading these pages!

	I post quotes, articles, and links on attention management over at <a href="/publications">The Attention Management Blog</a>.
I post neat things I find online to <a href="http://manjunathmstore.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">my store</a>.
I'm on Twitter. Frankly, when people say "you should follow me on <i class="icon-twitter"></i>Twitter", it pisses me off. So I'm not going to tell you what to do. If you want to see my account, though, it's at <a href="http://twitter.com/manjumk">@manjumk</a>.
